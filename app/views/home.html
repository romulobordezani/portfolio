                        <p>   Coding since 2002 in different languages and frameworks, I'm still in love with web development, dazzled with the opportunities that internet brought to me, like the continuous learning and the infinite challenge source.</p>

                        <p>   I'm experienced with server and frontend development focused in ubiquitousness and responsivess for high audience. </p>

                        <p>   <a href ng-href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/uol.com.br" target="_BLANK" > UOL</a>  employee since 2011, I'm working at the platform team building REST full applications, integrating Spring endpoints using Angular & Bootstrap, joined in a continuous integration pipeline using Jenkins and Node.js.

                        <p>   Also experienced with design and user experience working in advertising agencies, I got so many freelances that I've lost count. </p>

                        <p>   I loved to code using Flash, I built some games and interactive contents at Humor Tadela, dynamic data motions to corporate TV systems and commercial presentations. ( RIP Flash ).</p>

                        <p>   By now, I'm studying Node.js servers and Android native development, with Java and material design, just for fun. ;)</p>

                        <p>   I'm new using public <a href ng-href="https://github.com/romulobordezani" target="_BLANK" >repos</a>, so, I'm still learning and getting evolved with open source. </p>

                        <p>   I use to draw a lot when I was a child, so I became a professional illustrator working with Flash games and animations at Humor Tadela, a pioneer brazilian humor site.</p>

                        <p>   After all, I worked as a freelancer at some advertising agencies, being coachee for Art Directors as Reynaldo Andreatta, Gidelson Trigueiro and others, I had contact with Gestalt and the studies of form, meaning and emotion from Bauhaus school of design, Germany.</p>

                        <p>   A few years latter, I had to learn more about beauty and meaning ( semiotics ) when I worked for a brazilian bank called Itaú, approving jobs proposals from agencies and telling how to correct than as was expected, and why. </p>

                        <p>   It's hard to refuse someone else job and, the best way to do it is with good arguments, all based in a common knowledge, as Gestalt and Semiotics. </p>

                        <p>   To brief and to be briefed, makes me think that to put down in words subjective needs, is the most difficult job I ever seem. </p>

                        <p>   At last, I started to teach at UNIP university these visual studies and experiments from Bauhaus and also shared ( more getting than giving ) knowledge, ideas and visual repertory for five years. </p>

                        <p>   I got the key, even more after some Andre Christovam's classes over one year. </p>

                        <p>   Before I got married, I use to play the blues all night long, every weekend, but when my daughter was born, I started to play all night long just to make she sleep or stop to cry. </p>

                        <p>   There are two videos on Youtube from the old times with me and the Laundry Blues Band.

                        <p> I was raised in a poor family and we didn't have money enough to afford a college for me, but my mother and my aunt was working in the same college, called Faculdade das Américas ( Actual Flamingo ), and it makes everything easier to me.

                        <p> I convinced the rector to give me a scholarship in exchange of work, so I developed sites and internal system for him until get a post graduation done four years later.</p>

                        <p> At Itaú bank, I got another free scholarship at FIA(USP) to do a Master Business Administration degree about Human Resources Management. </p>

                        <p> After this, I came back to education environment in another college/university as a teacher, taught for five years at UNIP Digital Communication course, and leave the job because I needed the money of the employee founds (FGTS) to get married.</p>

                        <p> Now, I'm looking for another opportunity to teach again. Please let me know if you think that I could be useful in any kind of classes. I will enjoy it. </p>
